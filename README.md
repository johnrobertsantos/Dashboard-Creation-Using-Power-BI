# Project Portfolio: Dashboards

Welcome to my portfolio, where I present a collection of dashboards created using Power BI. These dashboards simplify complex data, making it easier to understand and use for decision-making. Each project highlights my skills in creating clear and effective visualizations that meet specific business needs.

## Dashboard 1
### Adventure Works Sales Report

This is the very first dashboard that I properly made. I was guided into how to make this. Techniques and complex DAX computations are somewhat minimal in this project as it is only intended to cover the basics and fundamentals. Visualization choices are pretty standard and the design could be a bit more modern - still many room for improvement. Though this is not bad as a a first dashboard I should say.

## Dashboard 2
### Finance Dashboard

This is my attempt to apply a rather modern and minimalist look to my dashboards, as well as some "creative" usages of DAX calaculation to create those parts of the dashboard where the line graph changes its component based on the option chosen. I also chose the color scheme for this dashboard to give the users a calmer view, but I think I should put more thought into it to improve color combinations by applying a effects like a gradient one and so forth. Though I should say that a good amount of space is somewhat wasted here - I could definitely put in more data visualizations in that dashboard. Thanks to the The Developer on YouTube by the way for the guide he made that I followed upon crafting this dashboard!
