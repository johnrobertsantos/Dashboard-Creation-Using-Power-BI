# Project Portfolio: Dashboards

Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase a collection of dashboards created using Power BI. These dashboards simplify complex data, making it easier to understand and use for decision-making. Each project highlights my ability to create clear and effective visualizations tailored to specific business needs.

## Dashboard 1
### Adventure Works Sales Report

This is the very first dashboard I created properly. I was guided on how to make it. Techniques and complex DAX computations are somewhat minimal in this project, as it is only intended to cover the basics and fundamentals. The visualization choices are fairly standard, and the design could be more modern—there’s still plenty of room for improvement. That said, it's not bad for a first dashboard.

## Dashboard 2
### Finance Dashboard

This is my attempt to apply a modern and minimalist look to my dashboards, along with some "creative" uses of DAX calculations to make the line graph change its component based on the selected option. I also selected the color scheme for this dashboard to give users a calmer view. However, I think I should put more thought into improving the color combinations by applying effects, such as gradients. Additionally, I must note that a good amount of space is somewhat wasted here—I could have included more data visualizations. Thanks to The Developer on YouTube for the guide that helped me craft this dashboard!

# Looking Ahead
Well, that's it for now! I plan to continue updating this repository with future dashboards to showcase my progress and share my journey. Creating dashboards can be challenging, especially at the start, but I’m confident that with time and practice, I’ll continue to improve. Here’s to refining my skills and bringing more impactful visualizations in the future!
